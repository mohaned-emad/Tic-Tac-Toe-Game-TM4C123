# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-TM4C123

## Description 
This project implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game on the TM4C123 microcontroller. The game is designed to be played using a simple user interface connected to the microcontroller, providing a fun and interactive way to engage with embedded systems programming.

## Features
- **Interactive User Interface:** Players can interact with the game using push buttons and a display screen (Nokia 5110).
- **Game Logic Implementation:** Full implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game logic, including win detection, draw detection, and turn management.
- **Player Indicators:** Visual or LED indicators to show the current player's turn, and when the game ends.

## Hardware Requirements
- Tiva C TM4C123 Microcontoller
- Nokia 5110 Display
- Push Buttons
- Male - Female Jumbers
- Breadboard
- Resisors
- LEDs

## Software Requirements
- Keil uVision IDE

## Installation
- Clone or download this repository to your computer.
- Open the project in Keil.
- Set up the hardware on the kit
- Include the TivaWare C Series SDK in the project build path.
- Build and flash the project to the Tiva C TM4C123G microcontroller.

## Usage
1. **Starting the game**
   - After uploading the code and setting up the hardware, power on the system. The game will initialize and display the empty Tic Tac Toe board on the screen.
2. **Playing the game**
   - Use the push buttons to select the cell where you want to place your marker (X or O).
   - The game will automatically switch turns between Player 1 and Player 2.
   - The game detects a win or a draw and displays the result.
